MuteTab Chrome extension
http://www.mutetab.com/

MuteTab is a Chrome extension that helps you manage the sound coming from tabs in Google Chrome. It helps you to narrow down which tab(s) are making sounds and provides browser-wide management of tab muting (pausing YouTube, HTML5 Video/Audio, and QuickTime and stopping others), including automatically muting all background tabs(*).

* There are a few ways that your browser can make sound that are not detectable; see the FAQ at mutetab.com for further information.
