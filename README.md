MuteTab Chrome extension
=======

MuteTab is a Chrome extension that helps you manage the sound coming from tabs in Google Chrome. It helps you to narrow down which tab(s) are making sounds and provides browser-wide management of tab muting (pausing YouTube, HTML5 Video/Audio, and QuickTime and stopping others), including automatically pausing/stopping many background tabs.  It does not detect web audio.
